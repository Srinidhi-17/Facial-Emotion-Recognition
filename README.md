Project Title:
Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN

Project Description:
The Facial Emotion Recognition project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify facial expressions in images. The implemented CNN is trained on a dataset containing various facial expressions, and the project includes training, evaluation, and a sample prediction on a single image.
